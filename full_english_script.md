## PART 1: THE OPENING (0:00-0:30)

**1.** You have heard his name.

**2.** Sant Sevalal Maharaj.

**3.** You have seen his white flag flying in every thanda.

**4.** You have heard stories from your grandparents.

**5.** But do you know the complete story?

**6.** Do you know why he is called Maharaj?

**7.** Do you know what he did for our community?

**8.** This is the complete, verified history of our Satguru.


## PART 2: INTRODUCTION (0:30-1:00)

**9.** Jai Sant Sevalal Maharaj.

**10.** My Banjara brothers and sisters, this documentary is for you.

**11.** For 220 years, our community has preserved his memory.

**12.** But many of us know only fragments of his story.

**13.** We know he was divine.

**14.** We know he reformed our community.

**15.** We know he gave us dignity.

**16.** But today, we present the complete, documented history.

**17.** Based on historical records.

**18.** Government documents.

**19.** The traditional epic Sevabhaya.

**20.** And oral histories passed down through generations.

**21.** This is our heritage.

**22.** This is our pride.

**23.** This is the story of Sant Sevalal Maharaj.


## PART 3: THE BIRTH CONTROVERSY (1:00-1:30)

**24.** Our Maharaj was born on 15 February 1739.

**25.** This date is historically verified.

**26.** But his exact birthplace remains a matter of scholarly debate.

**27.** Karnataka claims Surgondankoppa in Shimoga district.

**28.** Official government records support this location.

**29.** Andhra Pradesh claims Sevagad in Anantapur district.

**30.** Traditional Lambadi bards and oral histories support this location.

**31.** Both claims have historical validity.

**32.** The discrepancy reflects our community's nomadic nature during that period.

**33.** What matters most is not WHERE he was born.

**34.** But WHAT he achieved for our people.

**35.** 15 February 1739 marks the birth of our greatest reformer.


## PART 4: THE LINEAGE (1:30-2:00)

**36.** Sant Sevalal Maharaj came from a distinguished Rajput lineage.

**37.** Father: Bheema Naik Ramawat Rathod.

**38.** Mother: Dharamani Yaadi, also revered as Dharmani Mata.

**39.** Grandfather: Ramji Naik Rathod.

**40.** Birth name: Seva Bhaya, also known as Shiv Rathod.

**41.** The surname Rathod is significant.

**42.** It connects our community to the Rajput warrior clans of Chittorgarh.

**43.** This is our ancestral heritage.

**44.** We are descendants of those who served Rana Pratap.

**45.** As a child, he herded cattle near Sirsigad.

**46.** A simple life of service and devotion.

**47.** Until the miracle that would establish his divinity.


## PART 5: THE DIVINE MIRACLE (2:00-2:30)

**48.** This event is recorded in the traditional epic Sevabhaya.

**49.** Recited by Lambadi bards for centuries.

**50.** Young Sevalal was by a stream near Sirsigad.

**51.** In present-day Telangana.

**52.** He felt the presence of Goddess Jagadamba.

**53.** Also known as Goddess Mariamma Yaadi.

**54.** He wished to offer her something.

**55.** But he possessed nothing.

**56.** No food.

**57.** No flowers.

**58.** No material offerings.

**59.** So he took mud and wheat.

**60.** With pure devotion, he prepared sheera from mud.

**61.** He prepared puri from wheat.

**62.** And offered them to the goddess.

**63.** Then, by divine grace, the mud transformed into real sheera.

**64.** The wheat into real puri.

**65.** This miracle established his divine nature.


## PART 6: THE RECOGNITION (2:30-3:00)

**66.** Those who witnessed this miracle understood immediately.

**67.** This was not an ordinary child.

**68.** This was a divine incarnation.

**69.** Blessed by Goddess Jagadamba herself.

**70.** From that day forward, he was recognized as spiritually awakened.

**71.** The community began to follow his guidance.

**72.** He became Guru to our people.

**73.** But to fully understand his significance, we must understand where we came from.

**74.** Our roots.

**75.** Our ancestral homeland.

**76.** The Mewar region of Rajasthan.

**77.** The land of Chittorgarh.


## PART 7: OUR RAJPUT HERITAGE (3:00-3:30)

**78.** This is our ancestral homeland.

**79.** Mewar region.

**80.** Chittorgarh fort.

**81.** The land where Rana Pratap fought for freedom.

**82.** We, the Banjaras—also called Lambadis and Gor—belonged to Rajput clans.

**83.** Specifically, the Rathod clan of Chittorgarh.

**84.** Our ancestors were not merely traders.

**85.** We were the logistics backbone of Rajput armies.

**86.** We supplied provisions to Prithviraj Chauhan's forces.

**87.** We transported grain and weapons for Rana Pratap.

**88.** We crossed mountains and rivers with our bullock caravans.

**89.** We were warriors and traders.

**90.** This is our heritage.

**91.** This is our legacy.


## PART 8: THE GREAT MIGRATION (3:30-4:00)

**92.** In the late 16th century, the Mughal Empire defeated Rana Pratap.

**93.** Our community became refugees.

**94.** We followed Rana Pratap into the forests.

**95.** Then began our great migration south.

**96.** Through Malwa in Madhya Pradesh.

**97.** Through Central India.

**98.** Through the Deccan region of Maharashtra.

**99.** Finally settling in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana.

**100.** Sant Sevalal's grandfather, Ramji Naik Rathod, led this migration.

**101.** He brought 360 families from Chittorgarh.

**102.** Approximately 2,000 to 3,000 people.

**103.** An entire community searching for a new homeland.

**104.** Our ancestors' journey of survival.


## PART 9: THE OPPRESSION WE FACED (4:00-4:30)

**105.** By 1739, when Sant Sevalal Maharaj was born, our community faced systematic oppression.

**106.** The caste system denied us dignity.

**107.** We were classified as outside the social hierarchy.

**108.** Nomadic communities were labeled "Criminal Tribes" by the British.

**109.** Not for crimes committed, but simply for being nomadic.

**110.** Our forests were confiscated.

**111.** Our traditional grazing lands were restricted.

**112.** Our water sources were controlled.

**113.** Our women faced violence from settled communities.

**114.** Our culture was dismissed as primitive.

**115.** Into this darkness, Sant Sevalal Maharaj brought light.

**116.** Into this oppression, he brought dignity.

**117.** Into this despair, he brought hope.


## PART 10: THE CHOLERA EPIDEMIC IN HYDERABAD (4:30-5:00)

**118.** Late 1700s.

**119.** Hyderabad city under Nizam rule.

**120.** A devastating cholera epidemic struck.

**121.** Hundreds dying daily.

**122.** The Nizam's royal physicians were helpless.

**123.** Traditional healers could not stop the deaths.

**124.** Fear paralyzed the city.

**125.** Then Sant Sevalal Maharaj arrived.

**126.** With no formal medical degree.

**127.** No hospital.

**128.** No modern equipment.

**129.** Only his profound knowledge of Ayurveda and Naturopathy.

**130.** He began treating cholera patients systematically.

**131.** Using herbs from the forest.

**132.** Using ancient healing knowledge.

**133.** And miraculously, people began recovering.


## PART 11: THOUSANDS OF LIVES SAVED (5:00-5:30)

**134.** Day after day, our Maharaj worked tirelessly.

**135.** Treating the sick without discrimination.

**136.** Hindu, Muslim, rich, poor—all received his care.

**137.** By the time the epidemic ended, he had saved thousands of lives.

**138.** This is historically documented.

**139.** The Nizam of Hyderabad heard of this extraordinary achievement.

**140.** He summoned Sant Sevalal to his royal court.

**141.** What happened next elevated our entire community.

**142.** The Nizam, impressed by his healing and wisdom, granted him a royal favor.

**143.** Permission for our community's cattle to graze in a protected area.

**144.** That area exists today.

**145.** Banjara Hills, Hyderabad.


## PART 12: BANJARA HILLS - OUR LEGACY (5:30-6:00)

**146.** Brothers and sisters, when you see Banjara Hills today, remember this.

**147.** That prestigious area bears OUR community's name.

**148.** Because of Sant Sevalal Maharaj's achievement.

**149.** The Nizam granted grazing rights to honor our Maharaj.

**150.** He even commissioned his royal court artist to paint Sant Sevalal's portrait.

**151.** Historical records indicate that portrait was transported to Bangalore.

**152.** Think about the significance.

**153.** A nomadic community, discriminated against everywhere.

**154.** Our spiritual leader, receiving royal recognition.

**155.** From one of India's most powerful rulers.

**156.** This was not just personal honor.

**157.** This was recognition of our entire community's dignity.

**158.** This is when the title "Maharaj" became universal among our people.


## PART 13: WHY WE CALL HIM "MAHARAJ" - PART 1 (6:00-6:30)

**159.** You call him Maharaj.

**160.** Your parents call him Maharaj.

**161.** Your grandparents called him Maharaj.

**162.** But do you know precisely why?

**163.** Maharaj means "Great King" in Sanskrit.

**164.** Yet he never wore a crown or ruled a kingdom.

**165.** There are five documented reasons why our community bestowed this highest title upon him.

**166.** Reason number one: Extraordinary Knowledge and Wisdom.

**167.** He mastered Ayurveda and Naturopathy to a degree that astounded royal physicians.

**168.** He created a comprehensive ethical framework—the 22 Seva Bollies.

**169.** He unified fragmented Banjara clans across vast geographical regions.

**170.** He provided guidance on health, family matters, justice, and spirituality.

**171.** His wisdom elevated our entire community.


## PART 14: WHY "MAHARAJ" - PART 2 (6:30-7:00)

**172.** Reason number two: Social Revolution.

**173.** Sant Sevalal Maharaj accomplished what seemed impossible.

**174.** He challenged the caste hierarchy that oppressed us.

**175.** He negotiated with the British colonial administration for our rights.

**176.** He secured agreements with the Nizam of Hyderabad.

**177.** He dealt with Mysore rulers on equal terms.

**178.** He created the thanda system—transforming us from nomads to settled communities.

**179.** Before him, we wandered without permanent homes.

**180.** After him, we had thandas, villages, identity, and legal recognition.

**181.** Reason number three: Divine Powers.

**182.** The traditional epic Sevabhaya documents miraculous healings.

**183.** Prophecies that manifested.

**184.** Divine interventions witnessed by thousands.

**185.** Our community believes he was an incarnation of Lord Shiva, blessed by Goddess Mariamma Yaadi.


## PART 15: WHY "MAHARAJ" - PART 3 (7:00-7:30)

**186.** Reason number four: Spiritual Tradition.

**187.** India has a sacred tradition of honoring enlightened teachers as Maharaj.

**188.** Vallabhacharya—called Mahaprabhu.

**189.** Chaitanya Mahaprabhu—revered across Bengal.

**190.** Sant Tukaram—honored by royalty.

**191.** Sant Sevalal Maharaj stands in this illustrious lineage of Bhakti saints.

**192.** Reason number five: Political Authority.

**193.** This is perhaps most significant.

**194.** He commanded respect from colonial powers.

**195.** He sat in negotiations with the British as an equal.

**196.** He secured land and grazing rights when our community had none.

**197.** He protected our interests when we were labeled criminals.

**198.** A man who could defend his people before empires.

**199.** A man who secured rights through wisdom, not violence.

**200.** That is Maharaj.

**201.** That is kingship without a throne.


## PART 16: THE SACRED WHITE FLAG (7:30-8:00)

**202.** In every Banjara thanda, you see two temples with two flags.

**203.** This is Sant Sevalal Maharaj's legacy.

**204.** The RED or PINK flag represents Goddess Jagadamba.

**205.** She accepts non-vegetarian offerings, reflecting our traditional practices.

**206.** The WHITE flag—the Sevadhwaj—represents Sant Sevalal Maharaj.

**207.** Strictly vegetarian, symbolizing absolute purity and celibacy.

**208.** This dual system is unique to our community.

**209.** It honors both the divine feminine power and our Guru's teachings.

**210.** The white flag represents his values.

**211.** Purity.

**212.** Celibacy.

**213.** Non-violence.

**214.** Peace.

**215.** When you see that white flag flying in your thanda, remember his sacrifice for our dignity.

**229.** Historical texts describe his death as occurring "in a mystic way."

**230.** Meaning he consciously chose his departure.


## PART 18: POHRADEVI - OUR BANJARA KASHI (8:30-9:00)

**231.** His legacy did not end with his physical departure.

**232.** Around 1900 CE, a devoted follower named Ratansingh Baba constructed his samadhi.

**233.** His final resting place.

**234.** At Pohradevi in Washim district, Maharashtra.

**235.** Today, we call this sacred site "Banjara Kashi."

**238.** A 150-foot tall Sevadhwaj.

**239.** An equestrian statue of our Maharaj.

**240.** Daily laser light and music shows depicting his life.

**241.** 13 galleries documenting our history.

**242.** An adjacent temple to Goddess Jagadamba.

## PART 19: NATIONAL RECOGNITION (9:00-9:30)

**245.** For 217 years after his death, Sant Sevalal Maharaj's legacy remained within our community.

## PART 20: THE 22 SEVA BOLLIES (9:30-10:00)

**258.** Brothers and sisters, here is the most important part.

**259.** Sant Sevalal Maharaj left us 22 core principles.

**260.** The Seva Bollies in our Gor Boli language.

**261.** These are not suggestions.

**262.** These are the ethical foundation of our community.

**263.** Seva Bolly number three: "Provide water to the thirsty. Selling water is the biggest sin."

**264.** He taught this in 1806.

**265.** Today, multinational corporations sell water while millions suffer thirst.

**266.** He was 220 years ahead of his time.

**267.** Seva Bolly number one: "Protect the forest and environment. Destroying forests means destroying yourself."

**268.** He taught environmental conservation when no one understood ecology.

**269.** Seva Bolly number ten: "Women and girls are living goddesses."

**270.** He established gender equality in the 18th century.

**271.** These 22 principles address environmental conservation, social justice, gender equality, family values, personal development, and cultural preservation.

**272.** In our next documentary, we will present all 22 Seva Bollies in complete detail.

**273.** How each one applies to your life today.

**274.** How to implement them in your family and thanda.

**275.** This is your heritage.

**276.** This is your identity.

**277.** This is your Dharmaguru's gift to you.

**278.** Preserve it.

**279.** Practice it.

**280.** Pass it to your children.

**281.** Jai Sant Sevalal Maharaj!
